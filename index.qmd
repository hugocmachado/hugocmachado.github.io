I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Western Ontario. My research focuses on political behaviour and beliefs, with an emphasis on culture and media. I am particularly curious about how people learn political ideas and the kinds of knowledge they mobilize when thinking about political issues. The research I am working on for my dissertation examines how belief structures interact with cultural contexts to shape political behaviour and identities. I love research, teaching, and finding new ways of transmitting knowledge in more engaging and effective ways. Research gives me the opportunity to spend time with puzzles and learn a little more about the world everyday; it's not always smooth sailing, but it's still sailing!
