## Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching combines theoretical knowledge of teaching and learning scholarship with practical applications that aim to increase student engagement and learning. With the use of interactive tools like Shiny applications, I can better help students to visualize and work through complex content. I believe in creating supportive learning environments where students with different strengths can develop their technical skills and critical thinking abilities.

## Interactive Teaching Tools

I've developed a series of interactive tutorials using R Shiny that help students visualize and understand complex statistical and methodological concepts. These applications provide hands-on learning experiences that complement traditional lecture formats.

### Featured Tutorial:

This interactive application allows students to explore the basics of regression analysis, including assumptions, coefficient interpretation, and diagnostics.

*Features:*

- Interactive quizzes stimulate learning through recall and repeated exposure to important concepts. 

- A mix of conceptual, logical, and practical tasks mobilize the different types of knowledge students need for statistical analysis

- Complete-the-code tasks train students on the hands-on skills they need to go from raw data to analytic products
