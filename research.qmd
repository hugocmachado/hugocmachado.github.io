## Research Interests

My research is currently focused on political psychology, cognition, public opinion, and methodology. I am particularly interested in:

- How political identities interact with belief structures
- Political cognition and information processing
- Public opinion formation and measurement
- Cultural contexts and their influence on political behaviour

## Current Research

### Dissertation Project

**Associative Diffusion and Belief System Consolidation: How Cultural Meanings Shape Political Identities in Contemporary Democracies**  
*University of Western Ontario*

My dissertation is focused on understanding how different cultural and informational environments lead to variation in the content and structure of political schemas. This research:

- Investigates the interaction between political identity formation and cultural influences
- Explores how belief structures mediate political behaviour
- Employs mixed methods including surveys and experimental approaches

I am currently developing this research under the supervision of Dr. Mathieu Turgeon.
