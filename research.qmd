## Research

I study how cultural, psychological, and institutional processes shape the way people organize political beliefs, and how those beliefs guide political behaviour in different contexts. My work brings together political behaviour, cultural sociology, and comparative politics to understand not only what people think, but how they structure and process their political ideas. For a more detailed description of my research, please check my CV tab.  

I also collaborate on projects examining:  

  - The mobilization and measurement of conspiracy beliefs across countries  
  - Emotional and physiological foundations of prejudice and political intolerance  
  - How everyday political discussions shape social evaluation and interaction  

### Dissertation Project

My dissertation investigates how cultural meanings and informational environments shape political identities and belief structures in contemporary democracies. I use surveys and experiments to explore how certain political beliefs and cultural markers coalesce, and how they influence political attitudes and participation. I am currently developing this research under the supervision of Prof. Mathieu Turgeon.
