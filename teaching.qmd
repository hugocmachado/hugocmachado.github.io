## Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching combines theoretical knowledge of teaching and learning scholarship with practical applications that aim to increase student engagement and learning. With the use of interactive tools and engaging activities, I can better help students to visualize and work through complex content. I believe in creating supportive learning environments where students with different strengths can develop their technical skills and critical thinking abilities. For a more comprehensive overview of my teaching experience, please check the CV tab for an updated description.

## Interactive Teaching Tools

I've developed a series of interactive tutorials using Shiny for my regression methods TAship. These applications provide hands-on learning experiences that complement traditional lecture formats and help solidify abstract statistical concepts.

### Featured Tutorial:

This interactive application allows students to explore the basics of regression analysis, including assumptions, coefficient interpretation, and diagnostics.
